<h4 align="center"> This figure shows a stripline transmission line, where a metal strip of width "w" is embedded in a dielectric with relative permittivity εr (ε = εr*εo), between conductive plates at y = 0 and y = b. Additional conductive plates have been inserted at x = 0 and x = a, shielding the stripline. The stripline is maintained at a potential Vo, while the four lateral metal walls are grounded. <h4/>

<h5 align="center"> The values used is the calculations were ε = 1, w = 2 mm, a = 10 mm, b = 4 mm and Vo = 1 V. <h5/>
